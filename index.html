                    A New York Times Notable Book: Cincinnati homicide detective Sonora
                    Blair hunts a serial killer who's playing with fire in Shamus
                    Award—winning author Lynn Hightower's chilling thriller.
                    A single mother of two children and a police specialist with the
                    Cincinnati Homicide Division, Sonora Blair is still awake in the
                    middle of the night when the call comes in. Mark Daniels has been
                    found in Mount Airy Forest handcuffed to the steering wheel of
                    his car, doused with accelerant, and set on fire. As the hideously
                    burned college student lies dying in the ER, he describes his killer:
                    blond, female, and a total stranger. But Mark may not have been the
                    intended victim.
                    Evidence points to a sexual fixation on his older brother, Keaton,
                    a teacher currently separated from his wife. Then the murderer—who
                    has been dubbed "Flash" by the media—calls Sonora one night, taunting
                    and mocking her. As the investigation heats up, the harassment
                    continues. The female psychopath knows intimate details about Sonora's
                    family and her past. As the criminal's monstrous plan becomes
                    chillingly apparent, Sonora must risk everything to corner a cunning killer.
